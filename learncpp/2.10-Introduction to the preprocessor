The preprocessor is best thought of as a separate program that manipulates the text in each code file.
Preprocessor directives start with # symbol.
Text changes only temporarily in-memory.
In C++, a macro is a rule that defines how input text is converted into replacement output text.

Object-like macros: #define MY_NAME "Alex"
The conditional compilation preprocessor directives : #ifdef, #ifndef, and #endif.
